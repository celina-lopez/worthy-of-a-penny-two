I'm super excited to have so much completed this far along. It helped that I was on the beach, soaking up the sun, completing this.

I will still need to make the interface to make the game run, but the background information is set in place. I will probably make a javascript canvas game and also have it avaiable to download. I just think that would be super neat (i also enjoyed coding with pygame).

So far we have the basics: Stories and Characters. The stories have chapters which have lines and options. Options are the choices you make that effect the character's love meter.

I seperated the characters from the story (creating a connection with StoryCharacters). Reason being is that I think it would be cool for people to post their unique characters. Each character would have a couple emotions (pictures of them with different expressions), and I think people could reuse them for sequels or a whole new story. I could see a world where someone makes a Character based on a celebrity, and fanfiction galore!


Hopefully, everyone would be able to find love soon!
