Created my first pygame dating sim... a while ago. 

I don't remember all what I used but this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GF6O6vNXCc&ab_channel=buildwithpython) helped me the most. Will be rebuilding this is my first project EVER and the code is god awful...

<div style="text-align: -webkit-center;">
	<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="aHk91Ng"><a href="https://imgur.com/aHk91Ng">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

Fun fact, used one of my friends as a waifu xD Watch give till end.

I rebuilt this three times over, but lost my javascript adaptation <i class="fas fa-sad-cry"></i> This was pre github (at the time, i didn't know what this was) and just had it on my Windows before I converted to Linux. <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i>

Probably for the best... but still my number one project!

Next up!
- Rebuild this in javascript or ruby... hmmmm
