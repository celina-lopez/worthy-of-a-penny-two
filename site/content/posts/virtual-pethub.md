This is my first post about my Virtual-Pethub project! This really should be called Github Tamagotchi but I didn't want to get hit with some legal trouble. ([Tabagotchi](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/9/11/16291060/tabagotchi-tab-decluttering-breather-tamagotchi-google-chrome-extension-rip) got taken down from the chrome-store but they still have the extension for firefox!). This little pet survives on your github contributions, a little gamified way to let others know if you are productive.

After spending several days experimenting with github’s image caching, I learned that it can be quite tricky to work with. I was inspired by other readme widgets and noticed that they all used SVGs, so I decided to create my own tamagotchi-like virtual pet GIF to add to my GitHub readme. However, I soon discovered that the widget would never update due to GitHub's [extreme caching with images](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/224). 

Now that its in a SVG format (which I have no familiarity with), it looks a little… bad. I basically made a black SVG of the original two panel GIF and layered them on top of each other, then used CSS to create the visual effect. 

If I can get this widget working, I think I’ll spend more time on the SVG to create a cuter version for readmes. Though it's been a bit of a struggle, I'm learning a lot about GitHub's image caching in the process and am excited to see where this experiment takes me.

As for the original GIF images… I made [chrome-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pet-mood-tracker/fpidnlaipemhlfgilocegokiipdbhagh?hl=en)! This time you can track a diary of your mood (represented by the tamagotchi). Also… still some bugs with this one but for the most part, you will have a cute pet tracker for chrome!
