I'm in the process of making an e-ink typewriter. Incredible! This is my first Raspberry Pi gadget and so far, I love it!
<div style="text-align: -webkit-center;">

</div>

Motivation? Who doesn't want an e-ink typewriter! It seems like this is what it is made for. 

I got my hands on a waveshare 7.2 inch e-ink display. Here is what you need to know to get started:

This [Medium E-Ink Article](https://medium.com/swlh/create-an-e-paper-display-for-your-raspberry-pi-with-python-2b0de7c8820c) to set it up the e-ink display and this [Backend Text Editor From Scratch](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/text-editor-from-scratch) video to help set up the backend.

Will update with more posts as I continue to develop.
